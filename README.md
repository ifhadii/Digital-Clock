# Digital-Clock

### A digital clock is a type of clock that displays the time digitally (i.e. in numerals or other symbols), as opposed to an analogue clock.

### Digital clocks are often associated with electronic drives, but the "digital" description refers only to the display, not to the drive mechanism. (Both ### analogue and digital clocks can be driven either mechanically or electronically, but "clockwork" mechanisms with digital displays are rare).
